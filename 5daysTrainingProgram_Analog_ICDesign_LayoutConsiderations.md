**Day 1**


***Topics Covered***

- Introduction to the 5 Days Training Program on Analog IC Design & Layout Considerations

- Overview of Analog, Digital, and Mixed-Signal IC Design flow

- Basics of Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuits

- Importance and applications of BGR circuits

- Introduction to the Cadence Virtuoso tool

- -on exposure to the Cadence design environment



In the morning session, we were introduced to Analog design, Digital design, and Mixed-Signal design, with a primary focus on Analog IC Design. The session mainly emphasized the introduction and basics of Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuits, their purpose, and their importance in analog IC applications.



In the afternoon session a basic overview of the Cadence Virtuoso environment was provided, followed by an initial hands-on session to understand the tool interface and basic circuit implementation.



If you want, I can also simplify it more or make it slightly more technical for VLSI standards.
